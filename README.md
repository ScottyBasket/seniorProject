# Intramurals Pro
This is a project that my team and I worked on for a month during school. We created a web application that uses Taylor University emails and will manage intramural sports. You have the ability to schedule all of the games manually as the president and even send out emails based on what group a student is in. Another thing you can do is see what games you have upcoming, your ranking, team color, and more. You can do everything you would need to set up an intramural system in any capacity.
